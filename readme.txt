A documentation management system.

== Description ==

_Documentation_ is intended to provide sound basic structures for a documentation management system.

Leveraging WordPress' framework and internal structures, the system provides a completely new section to manage documents independently from normal posts or pages.
Documents are complemented by their dedicated document categories and document tags, which allows to keep the documentation structures separate from the more blog-oriented posts or CMS-like pages.
It can be used to build a dedicated documentation site, a subsite for documentation in a multisite network or other creative deployments.

Documents can be attached to products in WooCommerce using [WooCommerce Documentation](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/woocommerce-documentation/).

### Widgets ###

The plugin provides several widgets that are used to display document links:

- Document Hierarchy : facilitates navigating and viewing the document hierarchy
- Document Children : displays links to children of documents
- Documents : to display sets of document links

### Shortcodes ###

The following shortcodes are available:

- [documentation_hierarchy]
- [documentation_list_children]
- [documentation_search_form]
- [documentation_documents]

Please refer to the documentation pages for details.
